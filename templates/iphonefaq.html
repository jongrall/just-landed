        <h1>What does Just Landed do?</h1>
        <p>Just Landed tracks U.S. domestic and U.S. inbound/outbound flights and tells you when to leave for the airport to pick someone up. The app also sends you push notifications when flights take off / land / are delayed etc.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <h1>Who is Just Landed for?</h1>
        <p>We built Just Landed to make airport pickup easier. Just Landed is designed around this use case, rather than for the person flying. Until now, most of us either leave too early for the airport and waste time waiting in the terminal, or disappoint whomever we&rsquo;re picking up by arriving late.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <h1>How do I use Just Landed?</h1>
        <p>Just search for a flight using its flight number, and tap on it to begin tracking the flight. Once you&rsquo;re tracking the flight we will send you important updates via push notification, as well as automatic reminders to leave for the airport.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <h1>How is Just Landed different from other flight trackers?</h1>
        <p>Just Landed is the only app that tells you when to leave for the airport to pick someone up. Unlike a calendar alert, Just Landed constantly adjusts your reminders based on your location and the latest flight data and traffic conditions. Our goal is to get you to the airport precisely on time. It also features dead-simple flight search and avoids the information overload and clutter of other flight tracking apps.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <h1>How does Just Landed calculate when I should leave for the airport?</h1>
        <p>Whenever you're tracking a flight, Just Landed also tracks your current location, even when the app is in the background or your phone is locked. We use your approximate location to figure out the driving time to the airport, taking into account current traffic conditions. Just Landed combines this with real-time flight data and estimates of the time for passengers to de-board and reach the terminal, to get you to the airport at precisely the right time.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <h1>Why can&rsquo;t Just Landed find my flight?</h1>
        <p>We license real-time flight data from a company that specializes in flights originating or departing within the US. They provide data on most of these flights, including freight, but private aircraft and some other flights may not be available for tracking. If you&rsquo;re unable to find a flight, and are unhappy about it, please <a href="mailto:support@getjustlanded.com?subject=Unable%20to%20find%20my%20flight.">let us know</a>.</p>

          <p>This version of Just Landed does not offer tracking of international flights that are not originating or departing within the US. If there&rsquo;s enough demand for international flight tracking, we may switch to another data provider. You can let us know what you need by <a href="mailto:support@getjustlanded.com?subject=Need%20international%20flight%20tracking.">sending us feedback</a>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <h1>I never got a reminder to leave for the airport, what gives?</h1>
        <p>We&rsquo;ve built Just Landed to be as reliable as possible. However, there are a few unavoidable scenarios in which you may not receive a reminder to leave for the airport: your device is turned off or has no reception and cannot receive push notifications; our hosting provider is experiencing an outage; you have disabled push notifications. Outages at our hosting provider are expected to be very rare.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <h1>How do I turn off the alert sounds?</h1>
        <p>Simply put your phone in silent mode. Just Landed will respect the device settings.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <h1>When will Just Landed be available for Android?</h1>
        <p>If you&rsquo;d like to see an Android version, please <a href="mailto:support@getjustlanded.com?subject=Just%20Landed%20for%20Android.">let us know</a>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <h1>Why doesn&rsquo;t Just Landed have international flights?</h1>
        <p>We wanted Just Landed to be as cheap as possible for our users. Unfortunately, the international flight data is quite expensive, which would force us to charge more, so we&rsquo;re launching without it. If you need international flight tracking, please <a href="mailto:support@getjustlanded.com?subject=Need%20international%20flight%20tracking.">let us know</a>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <h1>Why are take-off and landing alerts sometimes delayed?</h1>
        <p>For &ldquo;security reasons&rdquo;, the FAA requires that some flight data be delayed by up to 15 minutes. Sorry, we don&rsquo;t make the rules.</p>
    </div>
