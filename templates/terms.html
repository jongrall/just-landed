            <h2 id="acceptanceofterms">1. Acceptance of Terms</h2> 
            <p>SimplyListed provides a collection of online resources, mobile applications, and various email and communication services (referred to hereafter as &ldquo;the Service&rdquo;) to allow users who comply with SimplyListed's policies to offer, sell and buy certain goods subject to the following Terms of Service (&ldquo;TOS&rdquo;, &ldquo;Agreement&rdquo;, or &ldquo;Terms&rdquo;).

The TOS applies to all users of the Service, including without limitation users who are vendors, customers, merchants, contributors of content, information and other materials through the Service.</p> 
            <p>Should you object to any term or condition of the TOS, any guidelines, or any subsequent modifications thereto or become dissatisfied with SimplyListed in any way, your only recourse is to immediately discontinue use of SimplyListed.

            <p>The Service is available only to, and may only be used by, individuals who are 18 years of age and older who can form legally binding contracts under applicable law. You represent and warrant that you are at least 18 years old and that all registration information you submit is accurate and truthful. SimplyListed may, in its sole discretion, refuse to offer access to or use of the Service to any person or entity and change its eligibility criteria at any time. This provision is void where prohibited by law and the right to access the Service is revoked in such jurisdictions.</p> 
            <p>Individuals under the age of 18 must at all times use the Service only in conjunction with and under the supervision of a parent or legal guardian who is at least 18 years of age. In these cases, the adult is the user and is responsible for any and all activities.</p>

            <p>In addition, some services offered by SimplyListed may be subject to additional terms and conditions promoted by SimplyListed from time to time; your use of such services is subject to those additional terms and conditions, which are incorporated into this TOS by this reference.</p> 
            <p>Keep your password secure. You are fully responsible for all activity, liability and damage resulting from your failure to maintain password confidentiality. You agree to immediately notify SimplyListed of any unauthorized use of your password or any breach of security. You also agree that SimplyListed cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to keep your password secure. You agree not to provide your username and password information in combination to any other party other than SimplyListed without SimplyListed's express written permission.</p>

            <h2 id="content">4. Content</h2> 
            <p>You understand that all postings, messages, text, files, images, photos, video, sounds, or other materials (&ldquo;Content&rdquo;) posted on, transmitted through, or linked from the Service, are the sole responsibility of the person from whom such Content originated. More specifically, you are entirely responsible for each individual item (&ldquo;Item&rdquo;) of Content that you post, email or otherwise make available via the Service.</p> 
            <p>SimplyListed has no control over the quality, safety, morality or legality of any aspect of the items listed, the truth or accuracy of the listings, the ability of sellers to sell items or the ability of buyers to pay for items. SimplyListed does not pre-screen users or the content or information provided by users. SimplyListed cannot ensure that a buyer or seller will actually complete a transaction. Consequently, SimplyListed does not transfer legal ownership of items from the seller to the buyer.</p> 
            <p>SimplyListed does not control the Content provided by users that is made available on SimplyListed. You may find some Content to be offensive, harmful, inaccurate, or deceptive. Additionally, SimplyListed cannot guarantee the true identity, age, or nationality of a user. There are risks of dealing with underage persons or people acting under false pretense. Additionally, there may also be risks dealing with international trade and foreign nationals. SimplyListed encourages you to communicate directly with potential transaction partners through the tools provided by the Service. You may also wish to consider using a third-party escrow service or services that provide additional user verification. By using SimplyListed, you agree to accept such risks and that SimplyListed (and SimplyListed's officers, directors, agents, subsidiaries, joint ventures and employees) is not responsible for any and all acts or omissions of users on SimplyListed. Please use caution, common sense, and practice safe buying and selling when using SimplyListed.</p> 
            <p>Furthermore, the SimplyListed site and Content available through the Service may contain links to other websites, which are completely independent of SimplyListed. SimplyListed makes no representation or warranty as to the accuracy, completeness or authenticity of the information contained in any such site. Your linking to any other websites is at your own risk. You agree that you must evaluate, and bear all risks associated with, the use of any Content, that you may not rely on said Content, and that under no circumstances will SimplyListed be liable in any way for any Content or for any loss or damage of any kind incurred as a result of the use of any Content posted, emailed or otherwise made available via the Service. You acknowledge that SimplyListed shall have the right (but not the obligation) in its sole discretion to refuse, delete or move any Content that is available via the Service, for violating the letter or spirit of the TOS or for any other reason. You acknowledge that SimplyListed shall have the right (but not the obligation) to store or re-format your Content and display your Content via the Service and on third party sites in any way as SimplyListed chooses. </p> 
            <p>By posting Content on SimplyListed, it is possible for an outside website or a third party to re-post that Content. You agree to hold SimplyListed harmless for any dispute concerning this use. If you choose to display your own SimplyListed-hosted image on another website, the image must provide a link back to its listing page on SimplyListed.</p> 
            <p>SimplyListed considers any unsolicited suggestions, ideas, proposals or other material submitted to it by users via the Service or otherwise (other than the Content and the tangible items sold on the Service by users) (collectively, the &ldquo;Material&rdquo;) to be non-confidential and non-proprietary, and SimplyListed shall not be liable for the disclosure or use of such Material. If, at SimplyListed's request, any member sends Material to improve the Service (for example through forums or to customer support), SimplyListed will also consider that Material to be non-confidential and non-proprietary and SimplyListed will not be liable for use or disclosure of the Material. Any communication by you to SimplyListed is subject to this TOS. You hereby grant and agree to grant SimplyListed, under all of your rights in the Material, a worldwide, non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, fully-paid, sublicensable and transferable right and license to incorporate, use, publish and exploit such Material for any purpose whatsoever, commercial or otherwise, including but not limited to incorporating it in the API, documentation, or any product or service, without compensation or accounting to you and without further recourse by you.</p>

            <h2 id="thirdparty">5. Third Party Content, Sites, &amp; Services</h2> 
            <p>The SimplyListed site and Content available through the Service may contain features and functionalities that may link you or provide you with access to third party content which is completely independent of SimplyListed, including but not limited to web sites, directories, servers, networks, systems, information and databases, applications, software, programs, products or services, and the Internet as a whole.</p> 
            <p>Your interactions with organizations and/or individuals found on or through the Service, including payment and delivery of goods or services, and any other terms, conditions, warranties or representations associated with such dealings, are solely between you and such organizations and/or individuals. You should make whatever investigation you feel necessary or appropriate before proceeding with any online or offline transaction with any of these third parties.</p> 
            <p>You agree that SimplyListed shall not be responsible or liable for any loss or damage of any sort incurred as the result of any such dealings. If there is a dispute between participants on this site, or between users and any third party, you understand and agree that SimplyListed is under no obligation to become involved. In the event that you have a dispute with one or more other users, you hereby release SimplyListed, its officers, employees, agents and successors in rights from claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind or nature, known or unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way related to such disputes and / or our service. If you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which says: &ldquo;A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which, if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.&rdquo;</p>
