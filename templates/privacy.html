            <ul> 
                <li>The security of your personal information is important to us. Your SimplyListed account information is protected by a password for your privacy and security. You need to work to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer by signing off once you have finished using a shared computer.</li> 
                <li>When you enter sensitive information SimplyListed encrypts that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). SimplyListed follows generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once SimplyListed receives it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while SimplyListed strives to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, SimplyListed cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about security on SimplyListed's website, you can email SimplyListed at <script type="text/javascript">Rot13.write('<n uers="znvygb:fhccbeg@fvzcylyvfgrq.pbz">fhccbeg@fvzcylyvfgrq.pbz</n>')</script>.</li>

            <p>When you post a message or item for sale, your first name and last initial, username or alias is visible to other users. If you post personal information online that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return. SimplyListed may be required to disclose personally identifiable information under special circumstances, such as to comply with subpoenas or when your actions violate the SimplyListed Terms of Service. SimplyListed may disclose personally identifiable information to third parties if it believes it is necessary or appropriate in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringement, piracy, or other unlawful activity. In such events, SimplyListed may disclose name, street address, city, state, zip code, country, phone number, email address and company name. SimplyListed may share aggregated demographic information with business partners.</p> 
            <p>SimplyListed will not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with nonaffiliated parties except as specified in this Privacy Policy to provide products or services you have requested or when SimplyListed has your permission. It may be necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of SimplyListed's Terms of Service, as specified in this Privacy Policy or as otherwise required by law. In some cases, SimplyListed may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, customer information is typically one of the business assets that is transferred. SimplyListed will transfer information about you if SimplyListed is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, SimplyListed will notify you by email or by putting a prominent notice on the SimplyListed web site before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</p> 
            <p>When buying or selling items on SimplyListed, you may obtain another user's email address, shipping address and/or other information. Pursuant to SimplyListed's Terms of Service, you may only use this information in connection with and for the duration of the transaction in which you are engaged with the other user. This information should only be used for SimplyListed-related communications or for SimplyListed-facilitated transactions. SimplyListed has not granted you a license to use the information for unsolicited commercial messages. Without limiting the foregoing, without express consent from the user, you are not licensed to add any SimplyListed user to your email or physical mail list.</p> 
            <p>Without limiting the above, in an effort to respect your privacy and SimplyListed's ability to keep the community free from bad actors, SimplyListed will not otherwise disclose your personal information to law enforcement, other government officials, or other third parties without a subpoena, court order, legal process, or substantially similar legal procedure, except when SimplyListed believes in good faith that the disclosure of information is necessary to protect SimplyListed's rights, prevent imminent physical harm or financial loss, or to report suspected illegal activity.</p>
