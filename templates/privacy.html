            <h2>What We Do With Personal Information</h2>
            <p><strong>Just Landed App Users.</strong> When you use Just Landed to track a flight, we issue you a unique identifier that we use to recognize your device in the future and track flights on your behalf. We also collect your device's push notification token so that we can send you push notifications about relevant flight information, and we track your location so that we can estimate driving time and traffic conditions between your last known location and the airport. When using the Just Landed apps, you can opt to not send us your location or device push token, with the caveat that it will prevent us from alerting you about when to leave for the airport (you can still view flight information).</p>
            <p><strong>Emails and Newsletters.</strong> We use the personal information you provide to us when you send us emails or sign up to receive our newsletter in order to respond to your request â€” for example, to reply to your email or to send you communications about news and events related to the Company and our products. When you subscribe to our newsletter, your name and email address is sent to and stored by Campaign Monitor.</p>
            <p><strong>Website Visitors.</strong> Like most website operators, the Company collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. The Company's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how the Company's visitors use its websites. From time to time, the Company may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
            <p><strong>Aggregated Statistics.</strong> The Company may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites and users of its apps. For instance, the Company may monitor the most popular flight routes. The Company may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, the Company does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p>

        <div class="group">
            <h2>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
            <p>The Company discloses potentially personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on the Company's behalf or to provide services available at the Company's websites and in our apps, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. The Company will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, the Company discloses potentially personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when the Company believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of the Company, third parties or the public at large.</p>
            <p>If you have supplied your email address to the Company, we may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with the Company and our products. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. The Company takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>
